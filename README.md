<h3 align="center">How to Deploy WordPress Website on AWS using EC2</h3>

</div>

## üö® Tutorial

## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

Deploying a WordPress website on AWS involves leveraging various AWS services to ensure scalability, reliability, and security. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up a WordPress site using Amazon EC2 for hosting, Amazon RDS for database management, and Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) for efficient traffic distribution.

Additionally, we will utilize Amazon Route 53 for domain name management and DNS routing. This comprehensive approach not only simplifies the deployment process but also equips your WordPress site with the robust infrastructure needed to handle varying levels of traffic, ensuring optimal performance and uptime.


## üìê Architecture Diagram Overview

* Users will request to open WordPress website, that request will be received by Route 53 which is a domain Management Service in AWS.
* We will use Route 53 to host DNS entries of the website's domain.
* Route 53 will send request to Application Load Balancer (ALB), it handles distribution of the traffic, if you have multiple instances of the same website, it will handle all the incoming requests. 
* ALB also support SSL certificate through AWS Certificate Manager, we will use it to issue a new SSL certificate for our domain name and ALB will apply that SSL certificate and send request to EC2 instance.
* EC2 instance is a virtual server where we will install all the needed packages to run WordPress  and create files of our WordPress website.
* We will make EC2 and RDS accessible to public source and enforce security via Security Group rules.
* We will create an EC2 instance which will be our Virtual Server and RDS instance which will be used for Database Hosting.

## <a name="create-ec2-for-wordpress">‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Create EC2 for WordPress</a>

You can launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console as described in the following procedure.

To launch an instance:

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. From the EC2 console dashboard, in the Launch instance pane, choose Launch instance.

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a4fbf1d-377e-473d-9ee0-448976625bc9)

3. Under Name and tags, for Name, enter a descriptive name for your instance `WP-instance`.

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-16-17_28_49](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a4e6b48-b2a5-4d27-b5d0-78e574641e09)


4. Under Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image), Choose Quick Start, and then choose the operating system (OS) for your instance. For your first Linux instance, we recommend that you choose Amazon Linux.
5. From Amazon Machine Image (AMI), select `Amazon Linux 2 AMI`, that is marked Free Tier eligible.

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-16-17_28_49 copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceaf67fa-b784-468c-978c-0d089d8029de)

6. Under Instance type, for Instance type, choose t2.micro, which is eligible for the Free Tier. 
7. Under Key pair (login), for Key pair name, choose an existing key pair or choose Create new key pair to create your first key pair.

![Screenshot 2024-07-22 at 12 36 01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08865853-85fd-46b3-8a96-0ac68a8fda8c)

Note: If you choose Proceed without a key pair (Not recommended), you won't be able to connect to your instance using the methods described in this tutorial.

8. Enter Key pair name `wp-instance`, for Private key file format select .pem for use with OpenSSH.

![Screenshot 2024-07-22 at 12 40 40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fee1bf8-152e-4087-9e7c-c734179ef016)

9. Under Network settings, notice that we selected your default VPC, selected the option to use the default subnet in an Availability Zone that we choose for you, and configured a security group with a rule that allows connections to your instance from anywhere. For your first instance, we recommend that you use the default settings.

10. Make sure Auto-assign public IP is enabled, because we are creating the server in public subnet
11. Under Firewall (security groups), choose Create security group, enter security group name `WP-security-group`

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-16-17_28_49 copy 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/215d34c6-b973-4428-95fb-229ebcc3c3aa)

12. Under Inbound Security Group Rules, let's add two more rules:
* The first one is `HTTP` Rule and allow it from `anywhere`, everyone can make HTTP request to  the server.
* The second one is `HPPTS` Rule and allow it from `anywhere`, everyone can make HTTPS request to  the server.

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-16-17_28_49 copy 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0044974a-25ff-4329-8647-a236a04391ad)


13. For the storage you can get 30 GB under free tier, i will just keep it 15 GB which is sufficient and click on launch instance.

## <a name="connect-ec2-to-instance">‚û°Ô∏è Step 2 - Connect to EC2 instance via Instance connect</a>

1. After the instance is created and its on the running state, choose instance ID, and click on Connect button. 

![connect-ec2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a03613e-2f50-4aff-b791-0e7070d3527e)

2. Under EC2 Instance Connect, click Connect

![connectec2-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/336529a0-4913-438a-915e-036213536d49)

3. if you see the welcome message from the AWS command line, then you are successfully connected to the server.

![aws-command-line](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23070b03-c9a6-4b16-ad84-d9097d0a5444)

## <a name="connect-ec2-to-ssh">‚û°Ô∏è Step 3 - Connect to EC2 instance via SSH client (local Terminal)</a>

There is another way to Connect to EC2 instance which is via SSH client, local Terminal to connect to EC2 instance via SSH client.

1. Select the instance, and choose Connect button.
2. Choose `SSH client`, copy the SSH command to connect to EC2 instance, and paste it into your terminal.

![ssh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6b17555-1de0-46ac-bb9b-ae926a941d96)


3. Open your terminal in your computer and paste the SSH command (make you sure your key pair is saved in same folder as your local user in your computer).

4. Click `Yes` to continue then click Enter.

![terminal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9db2dd0e-4874-4ff4-9fed-8ed1260da6a2)


## <a name="install-apache">‚û°Ô∏è Step 4 - Install Apache on Amazon Linux 2</a>

We will run following command to ensure that all packages on the system are up-to-date with the latest patches and versions.

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

By running the following command, you install the Apache web server on your system, which can then be used to host websites and serve web content.

```bash
sudo yum install -y httpd
```

Let's start the Apache HTTP Server service by running the following command, By running this command, you initiate the Apache web server, enabling it to begin serving web content.

```bash
sudo service httpd start
```

To test it, go back to your EC2 console, copy the public IP of your EC2 instance and paste it in your browser.

![ec2-apache](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f015343-36a2-49a2-8e67-c96c15bce417)

![apache](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5348565-3c93-4f56-a45f-f55461c87a8b)


## <a name="install-php-mariadb">‚û°Ô∏è Step 5 - Install PHP & MariaDB on Amazon Linux 2</a>

By running this command, you install PHP 8.2 on your Amazon Linux system.

```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras install php8.2 -y
```

Next, let's install MariaDB, by running following command, you install MariaDB 10.5, which is a popular open-source relational database management system, on your Amazon Linux system.

```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras install mariadb10.5 -y
```

Let's start the MariaDB service, by running the following command, you start the MariaDB database server, enabling it to accept connections and handle database operations.

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

As you can see below the database is running.

![cmd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cf7ce96-10d0-4db1-b5db-540aedddc3ec)


Let's access the home directory `/home/ec2-user`, enter `cd ~` and `pwd` present home directory. 

![home-user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eeb3865-f573-4ae1-863a-3b28d869dc09)


## <a name="download-wordpress">‚û°Ô∏è Step 6 - Download the latest WordPress zip file</a>

Let's download latest WordPress files from  their official website.

By running the following command, you download the latest WordPress package to your current directory. This package can then be extracted and used to set up a WordPress site.


```bash
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
```

After the wordpress is download, run `ls` to see the wordpress file `latest.tar.gz` then run `tar -xzf latest.tar.gz` to unzip the file, lastly run `ls` to see the WordPress folder with all the necessary WordPress files.

![cmd-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69b41341-44c0-4cdc-8b52-8d28a7b52ce5)



## <a name="rds-wp">‚û°Ô∏è Step 7 - Create RDS instance for WordPress website</a>


WordPress needs a database to run properly, we need to create a database before we the installation of WordPress. 

Note: For the database you have two options:
* Option 1. You can create a database locally on EC2 instance and connect it locally via local host.
* Option 2. You can create RDS instance and host your database on it (it's recommend to keep the database separate on RDS instance for durability and security reasons).

Amazon RDS DB instances simplify the deployment and management of relational databases, enabling you to focus on your application development and business logic rather than database maintenance tasks.

To create a DB instance:

 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.
 2. In the upper-right corner of the Amazon RDS console, choose the AWS Region in which you want to create the DB instance. (make sure your AWS Region is the same as your EC2 instance).
 3. In the navigation pane, choose Databases.
 4. Choose Create database, then choose Standard create.
 5. For Engine type, choose MySQL.
 6. For Version, choose the engine version.

 ![RDS-us-east-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc2a208b-847b-4b3e-a2e9-40c62b3c305c)

7. Select Free Tier so we don't get unexpected  monthly bill for our database instance.

![RDS-us-east-1 copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dad49041-fb77-407a-8088-9b0d2e6b21c2)

8. Type a name for your DB instance `wp-database`
9. Type a login ID for the master user of your DB instance `admin`
10. Ender Credentials management, select `Self managed` to create your own password or have RDS create a password
that you manage.
11. Choose `Auto generate password` Amazon RDS can generate a password for you, or you can specify your own password.
12. For Instance confiquration, select `db.t3.micro`

![RDS-us-east-1 copy 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35cb92e1-30dc-46ed-9f6b-007c25db7bcc)

13. For the Allocated storage, enter the minimum value of `20 GiB`

![RDS-us-east-1 copy 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2d06e5d-d3b1-4507-af98-92548eefffd6)


14. In the Connectivity section, make sure to select same VPC as of your EC2 instance and default submit group.
15. For Public Access we want to keep it private for security select `No`
16. In the Connectivity section under VPC security group (firewall), if you select Create new, a VPC security group is created with an inbound rule that allows your local computer's IP address to access the database. Enter VPC security group name `rds-sg`

![RDS-us-east-1 copy 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24df58e2-4902-4622-bad8-6c12991375c1)

17. Enter initial database name `wp_database`
18. It's a good practice to encrypt your RDS instance I will select default key.

![RDS-us-east-1 copy 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/114cbb9e-3faa-41e7-bc37-15f2566731f4)

Note: AWS provide automated Backup Service which is additional cost. Once you are in production, it's recommend to use it, you can keep database backup up to last 35 days but for this demo I will disable Backup.

19. Enable deletion protection so it can protect your instance from accidental deletion.
20. Click Create database.

Note: Based on the options we selected you can see estimated monthly cost, the Amazon RDS Free Tier is available to you for 12 months. Each calendar month, the free tier will allow you to use the Amazon RDS resources listed below for free:

![RDS-us-east-1 copy 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/239e1adc-a372-4a63-adda-cccfb664e523)

21. It will take about 2 to 5 minutes to create the database, once you see status is `available` click on **view connection details** to see  RS credentials, copy host username and password of the database somewhere safe as you will needed for database connection from our EC2 instance.

![RDS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acd614fd-280b-405b-b938-aa630e846009)



## <a name="connect-rds-ec2">‚û°Ô∏è Step 8 - Connect RDS and EC2 instance</a>

In this sttep, we need to add an inbound rule to RDS Security Group to allow connect to RDS, it's to make sure we can access database from our EC2 instance. 

* Open RDS and go to Security Group, we can see inbound is only allowed from one IP.

![sg1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/681d3645-8ce2-49bd-8486-e7ad7e7da3ad)

* We have created two security groups, one for EC2 and one for RDS instance.
* Copy Security Group ID of EC2 instance `wp-security-group`, select RDS Security Group `rds-sg`, select inbound rules and click on EDIT inbound rules.

![indound-rule](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3f131b8-e73f-419e-9729-0ccbc7ed405f)

* we will add rule, select type `MYSOL/Aurora`, Port is auto selected, then paste the ID of EC2 Security Group and add description click on Save rules.


![indound-rule-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71e56576-b189-4714-a0c6-d9ace515983d)


**Now let's check if these rules are workingopen** 

* EC2 instance dashboard and click on connect. 
* we will just use EC2 instance connect method.

![ec2-connect](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18f12bac-e1e2-4f45-8f7a-b68bd9432e1d)


* To quickly verify the connection to database, run the following command:

In my case:

```bash
mysql -h wp-database.cr2g2a04mnil.us-east-l.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
```

In you case (get from connection details to your database wp-database):

```bash
mysql -h wp-database.YOUR-ENDPOINT -u YOUR-USERNAME -p YOUR-PASSWORD
```
Note: Whenever you are typing your password, will not see it writing any text this is a Linux security feature, just paste your password hit Enter.  

* If you see welcome message and my SQL terminal  then you are successfully able to connect to RDS instance.
* To check if the database is created run the following command

```bash
 show databases;
 ```

 * As we can see below `wp_database` is already present, we have successfully connect our database. 


![cmd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184ef34a-1a45-4f2d-a28d-bc04d6d476c0)

 Next we  can start the process of Wordpress installation.


## <a name="install-wp-on-ec2">‚û°Ô∏è Step 9 - WordPress Installation on Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance</a>

To install WordPresson on Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance:

1. The following command copies all files and subdirectories from the wordpress directory to the `/var/www/html/` directory, using superuser privileges to ensure the operation has the necessary permissions. This is typically used when setting up a WordPress website on a web server.


```bash
sudo cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
```

2. Run the following command to add the `ec2-user` to the apache group on a Linux system.

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G apache ec2-user
```

3. By running the following command, you changes the ownership of the `/var/www` directory and all its contents to the user ec2-user and the group apache. This is often done to ensure that the `ec2-user` has the necessary permissions to manage web files and that the apache group has the appropriate access to these files, facilitating web server operations.


```bash
sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
```

4. The following command is typically used in web server environments to ensure proper permissions for web server processes and users, facilitating collaboration and proper access control.


```bash
sudo chmod 2775 /var/www && find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \;
```

5. The following command is used in a Unix-like operating system (such as Linux) to change the permissions of all files within the /var/www directory. The command finds all files within the `/var/www` directory and sets their permissions to `0664`.

```bash
find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \;
```

6.  Let's move to HTML folder by running

```bash
cd /var/www/html
```

7. As we can see below, we have `wp-config-sample.php` file, we will create a copy of this file and name it `wp-config.php`.  This file contains configuration of WordPress website.


![cmd4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b164752-b00b-4708-b4f5-152bc8681126)

8. Now let's edit `wp-config.php` file by running `nano wp-config.php`

* On the `wp-config.php` we need to change database parameters so WordPress can connect to our database
* Enter your database name, username and password, then paste host of the RDS instance as shown below.
* Once you are done editing hit Control + X to exit.

![edit-rds](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89e6eb41-5746-4291-bf7f-8d1a69c9f7a7)

* To check the changes we made run the command `cat wp-config.php`. As you can see below our file is modified with our database information.

![edit-rds2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e2546b2-431f-458b-b83e-345233c1e748)

* Next, we need to allow WordPress to use permalinks in Apache server, we will edit a parameter in Apache configuration file.
To do that, we need to use the following command to open config file in VIM Editor.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

* Change the `AllowOverride None` to `AllowOverride All`

Note: To type in VIM Editor, first press `i` key to get into insert mode, then you can  
type when you want, to quit from VIM Editor press `Escape(Esc)` key then write `:wq` and press Enter.


![edit-rds3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6d3d20b-ddda-4aad-b401-3f4c2247282b)

* If you're using PHP 7.4 or PHP 8.x, install the php-mysqlnd package this is a depencies needed for PHP to run well. php-mysqlnd provides support for mysqli, mysql, and PDO_MySQL
  
```bash
sudo yum install php-mysqlnd -y

```


* To make sure everything is saved and new settings are applied, we need to restart Apache server with restart command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

* Go back EC2 instance console, and click on public IP of the instance.

Note: If you click on the public IP link, sometimes you might get the error connection, that is not an actual server error that is your browser doing `https` request rather than `http` request, just remove s at the end and press enter.

![ip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae13aa35-6eb2-4d34-8311-08ae8895d8d3)

As you can see below we have the WordPress Welcome Page

* Fill in the information, enter your Site Title, Username, Password and Your Email, then click Install WordPress.

![wp1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e071afd2-b211-496f-a299-7bcbeb602217)


* Now you have successfully installed WordPress on your server.

![wp2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbc58b58-ef46-4e57-b277-c7b510c6fd14)

* To login enter your email and password and click on login.

![wp3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d562bc2d-a17c-4d84-9ec5-b5e89cebf604)

* It will open the WordPress Admin Panel to manage contents of your website.

<h3 align="center">How to Deploy WordPress Website on AWS using EC2</h3>

   <
</div>

## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

Welcome to Part 2 of our tutorial on deploying a WordPress website on AWS! In the first part, we set up our WordPress site using Amazon EC2 for hosting and Amazon RDS for the database. Now, we‚Äôre going to take it a step further by improving scalability, reliability, and performance.

In the second part, we‚Äôll configure an Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) to efficiently distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances efficiently, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. We‚Äôll also integrate Amazon Route 53, AWS‚Äôs powerful DNS service, to manage our domain and route traffic to our WordPress application smoothly, lastly, we will secure our website with a free SSL certificate by using Amazon certificate manager.

## üìê Architecture Diagram Overview

* Users will request to open WordPress website, that request will be received by Route 53 which is a domain Management Service in AWS.
* We will use Route 53 to host DNS entries of the website's domain.
* Route 53 will send request to Application Load Balancer (ALB), it handles distribution of the traffic, if you have multiple instances of the same website, it will handle all the incoming requests. 
* ALB also support SSL certificate through AWS Certificate Manager, we will use it to issue a new SSL certificate for our domain name and ALB will apply that SSL certificate and send request to EC2 instance.
* EC2 instance is a virtual server where we will install all the needed packages to run WordPress  and create files of our WordPress website.
* We will make EC2 and RDS accessible to public source and enforce security via Security Group rules.
* We will create an EC2 instance which will be our Virtual Server and RDS instance which will be used for Database Hosting.


## <a name="steps">‚òëÔ∏è Steps</a>

The procedure for deploying this architecture on AWS consists of the following steps:

* Step 1. [Create Application Load Balancer on AWS](#alb)
* Step 2. [Add a custom domain managed by a third-party DNS provider](#domain-provider)
* Step 3. [Set up Free AWS SSL certificate](#ssl-certificate)


## <a name="alb">‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Create Application Load Balancer on AWS</a>

We are going to create an Application Load Balancer to point to our EC2 Instance.

To configure your load balancer:

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
2. In the navigation pane, choose Load Balancers
3. Choose Create Load Balancer.

![alb1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebaff0aa-e955-4b27-a87d-ffde95a0d8e9)


4. Under Application Load Balancer, choose Create.

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-17-15_08_53](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e15e3606-11b6-4d8b-9a14-6335137a66a9)


5. For Load balancer name, enter a name for your load balancer `wp-lb`
6. For Scheme, choose Internet-facing. An internet-facing load balancer routes requests from clients to targets over the internet.
7. For IP address type, choose IPv4, Dualstack, or Dualstack without public IPv4. Choose IPv4 if your clients use IPv4 addresses to communicate with the load balancer. Choose Dualstack if your clients use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to communicate with the load balancer. Choose Dualstack without public IPv4 if your clients use only IPv6 addresses to communicate with the load balancer.

10. For Security groups, let's create a new one. 

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-17-15_40_20 copy 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13d0d131-c053-4587-a3c7-01faf0e1e508)


11. Enter Security group name `wp_lb-SG`
12. Make sure your default VPC is selected
13. For Inbound rules, we are going to create 2 new rules, one for `HTTP` and `HTTPS` Rules with source of `0.0.0.0/0`
14. Keep Outbound rules as default
15. Use a tag as a label that you assign to an AWS resource with Key=`Name` and Value=`LB-SG`
16. Click Create security group

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-17-15_15_26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5367e45c-3574-4487-a120-1c8fe1c318bb)


17. Go back to Application Load Balancer and select the new `wP_lb-SG` security group.
18. Under Listeners and routing, a listener is a process that checks for connection requests using the port and protocol you configure, let's create a new target group, choose Create target group.

![Screenshot 2024-07-27 at 11 45 43](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14a6096f-9ef4-4659-ab55-ff7d210959bd)

19. Choose Instances as target type 
20. Enter Target group name `wp-site-TG`
21. Select your default VPC and keep everything as default, click Next

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-17-15_20_09](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a723731-0e23-4b96-a676-e550ebc9ba9b)

22. Under Register targets, let's select the EC2 instance and click on Include as pending below.
23. Once the EC2 instance is add to the Review targets, click Create target group.

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-17-15_21_54](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fa9d45d-4e07-44ba-99f1-d1b73b6d2c8e)


24. We have created our WordPress site Target group and currently it's not associated with any load  balancer, let's add it to our load balances. Back to Application Load Balancer select the new target group `wp-site-TG`


![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-17-15_40_20 copy 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8964594a-07f4-47e6-b670-ded627517b25)


25. Keep the rest as default.
26. Review the load balancer configurations, we've created:
* An Internet-facing Load Balancer
* A Security groups
* A Network mapping with 1 VPC and 3 availabity zones
* 1 Target group 

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-17-15_40_20 copy 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e2fba1a-55c8-4468-9d4c-79f50db7ea8c)

The Target group will be associated to the Load Balancer, and the EC2 instance will be added to the Target group and make sure the EC2 instance is healthy, lastly our load balancer will be in active State.

Let's test our Application Load Balancer, copy DNS name of the load balancer and and open it on a new browser.

![alb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9efa1aa-2456-497f-8a83-9e1fb2e6b7f0)

As you can see below we can now access our WordPress site from Load Balancer DNS.


![wp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cee5c9d2-5058-4862-ab66-f0a94dd4f46b)


Next, we need to edit the security group in such a way that our application load balancer can only be accessed from HTTP and HTTPS traffic from our load  balancer Security Group and not from all IP addresses(`0.0.0.0/0`).

* Go to EC2 Instance conlose, then choose security group.
* Copy the ID of the load balancer Security Group 
* select Security Group attached to EC2 instance and go to inbound rules click on edit inbound.

![sg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc1a728a-4e59-4fb4-9f05-f15080834488)

* We have to create two new rules which only allow HTTPS and HTTPS traffic from our load balancer Security Group and not from the whole.
* Paste the security group ID from application load balancer and click Save.

![sg2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/570dd5b0-b7bd-4a77-a8ec-c688551b4c21)

We are now only allowing traffic  from ALB and not from any other source.


## <a name="domain-provider">‚û°Ô∏è Step 2 - Add a custom domain managed by a third-party DNS provider</a>

If you are not using Amazon Route 53 to manage your domain, you can add a custom domain managed by a third-party DNS provider to your application.

We are going to create a Public Hosted Zone, which is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain, such as `example.com`, after you create a hosted zone, you create records that specify how you want to route traffic for the domain and subdomains.

To create a public hosted zone using the Route 53 console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/
2. If you're new to Route 53, choose Get started under DNS management. If you're already using Route 53, choose Hosted zones in the navigation pane.
3. Choose Create hosted zone.

![route-53-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7734f6e-4c48-4f9a-a586-1387cfd09cda)


4. In the Create Hosted Zone pane, enter the name of the domain that you want to route traffic for, in my case it's `julienmuke.cloud` which is domain that i purchased from [hostinger.com](www.hostinger.com)
5. For Type, accept the default value of Public Hosted Zone.
6. Choose Create.

![Route-53-Global](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a87632e9-420a-40b8-aa4c-251d1c62e57f)

Note: By default you will get two records for your domain which are SOA and NS.
NS stands for Name Server record which determine the location of your domain and help you manage mapping, we have to add this name servers to our domain provider so the provider can know where is your DNS hosted in my case it's [hostinger.com](www.hostinger.com).

Now, let's add the Name Server record to Hostinger. 

* Copy the Name Server value from Route 53.

![53-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c7b8db7-1682-4776-a130-699667612f16)

* Paste the Name Server value to DNS Nameservers in Hostinger.

![53-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/790ec3ce-742a-4eb6-8cd1-32fb57f0adee)

* Next, we will Create records that specify how you want to route traffic for the domain, so that when anyone opens our domain URL it will show the WordPress website from the load balancer.

* Click on Create record

![53-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84e95410-4145-4391-b93b-17dc967846b6)

* Keep the Record name blank 
* There are various DS record types, make sure to select **A - Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources**
* Enable Alias
* Select Alias Alias to Application and Classic Load Balancer.
* Select your region where you have created your load balancer i will select North Virginia
* Select our WordPress application load balancer 
* Keep everything else default and click on create records

![53-4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b30b70a-cc5e-4928-bed0-088ba752d2ad)

Next, we will create a record to migrate traffic from `www` to our domain, so if anyone adds `www` in front of your domain, it will not throw error rather it will redirect to your main domain.

* Enter `www` record name, make sure you select record type **A - Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources**
* Enable Alias
* Choose **Alias to another record in this hosted zone**
* Select record created `julienmuke.cloud.` previously and click create record.

![53-5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87a4539b-4886-44a3-ac38-a3ee56c29beb)


Now any traffic coming to `www` record will go to load balance at DNS.


## <a name="ssl-certificate">‚û°Ô∏è Step 2 - Set up Free AWS SSL certificate</a>

Let's move to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to request a Free SSL certificate for our domain.

To request an ACM public certificate (console):

1. In the AWS Management Console and open the ACM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home.
2. Choose Request a certificate.
3. Choose Request a public certificate, click Next.

![53-6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e6e8413-1b70-45d9-9ab0-dcd74f1834d5)

4. In the Domain names section, type your domain name, mine is `julienmuke.cloud`
5. To add another name, choose Add another name to this certificate and type the name in the text box. This is useful for protecting both a bare or apex domain (such as example.com) and its subdomains such as (*.example.com) in my case i will add `*julienmuke.cloud`
6. In the Validation method section, choose either DNS validation ‚Äì recommended.
7. In the Key algorithm section, choose RSA 2048 (default) then click Request.

![Request-public-certificate-Certificate-Manager-us-east-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e90fe1f1-dd6c-4370-8ccc-1e01b5aa0b9a)

8. Click on view certificate, it will be in Pending validation status.(it will take 3-5 minuntes to validate).
9. Next, click on Create DNS records in Amazon Route 53, which will add records to our host Zone.

![53-7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/989128aa-4677-477d-83cf-00fb7d45e32f)

10. Select your Domains, and click Create records.

![53-8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7122fbe7-4ca5-4244-9a80-c5cfb7734f81)


11. Let's add SSL certificate to our Load Balancer:

a. Go to the ECS conlose, then select Load Balancer, click on the existing one
b. Under Listeners and rules, click on Add listener

![53-10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8cce2bf-d031-49cc-9cc5-cf60000b5eef)

c. Select `HTTPS` as Protocol, and the Port will be 443.
d. Select the Target group `wp-site-TG`


![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-18-12_26_44 copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36e137e9-3ea1-4428-ba38-68abb11ce98d)


e. Under Default SSL/TLS server certificate, select the certificate that will be applied as the default SSL/TLS server certificate for this load balancer's secure listeners.
f. Keep everything as default and click Add

![screencapture-us-east-1-console-aws-amazon-ec2-home-2024-07-18-12_26_44 copy 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/240d7e93-9b7a-45e2-ad69-b280c6a5b36a)

Next, let's redirect all traffic coming from HTTP to HTTPS.

1. Go to EC2 console, then Load Balancer and select the `wp-lb`
2. Under Listeners and rules select `HTTP:80`, click on Edit Rules

![3242](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4791833-3d0e-438a-8fdb-b67df4b1e713)

3. Select Default rules, go to Actions and select Edit rule

![6545](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b53c6f3b-e1dc-4d52-be11-3aa8b89009f2)

4. Under Routing actions, select "Redirect to URL"
5. Keep "Protocol" as `HTTPS` and enter "Port" = `443` then click "Save changes"

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3dde6ab-186a-47f9-8640-916ad114931c)


Before we test our website, let's edit the `wp-config.php` to allow proper `HTTPS` request

- Go back to your EC2 instance console, select your instance `wp-instance`
- Click on "Connect", choose "EC2 instance connect" then click "Connect" 
- Change the directory to access the website, run the following command:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/
```

- To edit `wp-config.php` let's use vim editor, run the following command:

```bash
sudo vim wp-config.php
```
- To edit in vim editor type `i` key to enter into insert mode.
- Then paste the code below:

```bash
if ($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https')
    $_SERVER['HTTPS']='on';

define( 'WP_HOME', 'http://YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME' );
define( 'WP_SITEURL', 'http://YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME' );
```

Note: This code will tell the server to use `HTTPS` protocole, make sure you change the URL to your own domain name.

- Once you are done, to save the change and exit vim editor, type `Esc` key then type `:wq`

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/608730be-a4c1-49b2-9f08-29394916366b)

To test the website, enter your domain name in the URL bar. You should be able to see your new WordPress site.

üèÜ You have successfully set up a WordPress website on AWS. It features an Amazon Application Load Balancer connected to the domain name through Amazon Route 53 and a secure SSL certificate.
